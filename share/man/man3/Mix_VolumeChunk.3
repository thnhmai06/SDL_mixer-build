.TH Mix_VolumeChunk 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_VolumeChunk \- Set the volume for a specific chunk\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int Mix_VolumeChunk(Mix_Chunk *chunk, int volume);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
In addition to channels having a volume setting, individual chunks also
maintain a separate volume\[char46] Both values are considered when mixing, so both
affect the final attenuation of the sound\[char46] This lets an app adjust the
volume for all instances of a sound in addition to specific instances of
that sound\[char46]

The volume must be between 0 (silence) and 
.BR MIX_MAX_VOLUME

(full volume)\[char46] Note that 
.BR MIX_MAX_VOLUME
 is 128\[char46] Values
greater than 
.BR MIX_MAX_VOLUME
 are clamped to

.BR MIX_MAX_VOLUME
\[char46]

Specifying a negative volume will not change the current volume; as such,
this can be used to query the current volume without making changes, as
this function returns the previous (in this case, still-current) value\[char46]

The default volume for a chunk is 
.BR MIX_MAX_VOLUME
 (no
attenuation)\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I chunk
the chunk whose volume to adjust\[char46]
.TP
.I volume
the new volume, between 0 and 
.BR MIX_MAX_VOLUME
, or -1 to query\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the previous volume\[char46] If the specified volume is -1, this
returns the current volume\[char46] If
.BR chunk
is NULL, this returns -1\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
