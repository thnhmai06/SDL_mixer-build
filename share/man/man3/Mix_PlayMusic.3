.SH DESCRIPTION
This will schedule the music object to begin mixing for playback\[char46]

There is only ever one music object playing at a time; if this is called
when another music object is playing, the currently-playing music is halted
and the new music will replace it\[char46]

Please note that if the currently-playing music is in the process of fading
out (via 
.BR Mix_FadeOutMusic
()), this function will
.I block
until the fade completes\[char46] If you need to avoid this, be sure to
call

() before starting new music\[char46]

.I music
the new music object to schedule for mixing\[char46]
.TP

the number of loops to play the music for (0 means "play once and stop")\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call SDL_GetError() for
more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
