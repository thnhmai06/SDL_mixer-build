.TH Mix_RegisterEffect 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_RegisterEffect \- Register a special effect function\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool Mix_RegisterEffect(int chan, Mix_EffectFunc_t f, Mix_EffectDone_t d, void *arg);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
At mixing time, the channel data is copied into a buffer and passed through
each registered effect function\[char46] After it passes through all the functions,
it is mixed into the final output stream\[char46] The copy to buffer is performed
once, then each effect function performs on the output of the previous
effect\[char46] Understand that this extra copy to a buffer is not performed if
there are no effects registered for a given chunk, which saves CPU cycles,
and any given effect will be extra cycles, too, so it is crucial that your
code run fast\[char46] Also note that the data that your function is given is in
the format of the sound device, and not the format you gave to

.BR Mix_OpenAudio
(), although they may in reality be the same\[char46]
This is an unfortunate but necessary speed concern\[char46] Use

.BR Mix_QuerySpec
() to determine if you can handle the data
before you register your effect, and take appropriate actions\[char46]

You may also specify a callback (
.BR Mix_EffectDone_t
) that
is called when the channel finishes playing\[char46] This gives you a more
fine-grained control than 
.BR Mix_ChannelFinished
(), in
case you need to free effect-specific resources, etc\[char46] If you don't need
this, you can specify NULL\[char46]

You may set the callbacks before or after calling

.BR Mix_PlayChannel
()\[char46]

Things like 
.BR Mix_SetPanning
() are just internal special
effect functions, so if you are using that, you've already incurred the
overhead of a copy to a separate buffer, and that these effects will be in
the queue with any functions you've registered\[char46] The list of registered
effects for a channel is reset when a chunk finishes playing, so you need
to explicitly set them with each call to

.BR Mix_PlayChannel
*()\[char46]

You may also register a special effect function that is to be run after
final mixing occurs\[char46] The rules for these callbacks are identical to those
in 
.BR Mix_RegisterEffect
, but they are run after all the
channels and the music have been mixed into a single stream, whereas
channel-specific effects run on a given channel before any other mixing
occurs\[char46] These global effect callbacks are call "posteffects"\[char46] Posteffects
only have their 
.BR Mix_EffectDone_t
 function called when
they are unregistered (since the main output stream is never "done" in the
same sense as a channel)\[char46] You must unregister them manually when you've had
enough\[char46] Your callback will be told that the channel being mixed is

.BR
.BR MIX_CHANNEL_POST
if the processing is considered a
posteffect\[char46]

After all these effects have finished processing, the callback registered
through 
.BR Mix_SetPostMix
() runs, and then the stream goes
to the audio device\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS

.TP
.I d
effect done callback\[char46]
.TP
.I arg
argument\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE

more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
