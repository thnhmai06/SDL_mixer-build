.SH NAME
Mix_GetNumMusicDecoders \- Get a list of music decoders that this build of SDL_mixer provides\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int Mix_GetNumMusicDecoders(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This list can change between builds AND runs of the program, if external
libraries that add functionality become available\[char46] You must successfully
call 
.BR Mix_OpenAudio
() before calling this function, as
decoders are activated at device open time\[char46]

Appearing in this list doesn't promise your specific audio file will
decode\[char46]\[char46]\[char46]but it's handy to know if you have, say, a functioning Ogg Vorbis
install\[char46]

These return values are static, read-only data; do not modify or free it\[char46]
The pointers remain valid until you call

.BR Mix_CloseAudio
()\[char46]

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns number of music decoders available\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
