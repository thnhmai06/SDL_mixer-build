.SH DESCRIPTION
You may not need to call this at all, unless you need to stop an effect
from processing in the middle of a chunk's playback\[char46]

Posteffects are never implicitly unregistered as they are for channels (as
the output stream does not have an end), but they may be explicitly
unregistered through this function by specifying

.BR MIX_CHANNEL_POST
 for a channel\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I channel
the channel to unregister an effect on, or 
.BR MIX_CHANNEL_POST
\[char46]
.TP
.I f
effect the callback stop calling in future mixing iterations\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call SDL_GetError() for
more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
