.TH Mix_SetPanning 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_SetPanning \- Set the panning of a channel\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool Mix_SetPanning(int channel, Uint8 left, Uint8 right);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The left and right channels are specified as integers between 0 and 255,
quietest to loudest, respectively\[char46]

Technically, this is just individual volume control for a sample with two
(stereo) channels, so it can be used for more than just panning\[char46] If you
want real panning, call it like this:

.IP
.EX
Mix_SetPanning(channel, left, 255 - left);
.EE
.PP

Setting
.BR channel
to 
.BR MIX_CHANNEL_POST
 registers this as
a posteffect, and the panning will be done to the final mixed stream before
passing it on to the audio device\[char46]

This uses the 
.BR Mix_RegisterEffect
() API internally,
and returns without registering the effect function if the audio device is
not configured for stereo output\[char46] Setting both
.BR left
and
.BR right
to 255
causes this effect to be unregistered, since that is the data's normal
state\[char46]

Note that an audio device in mono mode is a no-op, but this call will
return successful in that case\[char46] Error messages can be retrieved from

.BR Mix_GetError
()\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I channel
The mixer channel to pan or 
.BR MIX_CHANNEL_POST
\[char46]
.TP
.I left
Volume of stereo left channel, 0 is silence, 255 is full volume\[char46]
.TP
.I right
Volume of stereo right channel, 0 is silence, 255 is full volume\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call SDL_GetError() for
more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
