Pausing a channel will prevent further playback of the assigned chunk but
will maintain the chunk's current mixing position\[char46] When resumed, this
channel will continue to mix the chunk where it left off\[char46]

A paused channel can be resumed by calling 
.BR Mix_Resume
() or

.BR Mix_ResumeGroup
()\[char46]

A paused channel with an expiration will not expire while paused (the
expiration countdown will be adjusted once resumed)\[char46]

A tag is an arbitrary number that can be assigned to several mixer
channels, to form groups of channels\[char46]

The default tag for a channel is -1\[char46]
