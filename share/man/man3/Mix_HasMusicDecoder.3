.SH NAME
Mix_HasMusicDecoder \- Check if a music decoder is available by name\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool Mix_HasMusicDecoder(const char *name);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This result can change between builds AND runs of the program, if external
libraries that add functionality become available\[char46] You must successfully
call 
.BR Mix_OpenAudio
() before calling this function, as
decoders are activated at device open time\[char46]

Decoder names are arbitrary but also obvious, so you have to know what
you're looking for ahead of time, but usually it's the file extension in
capital letters (some example names are "MOD", "MP3", "FLAC")\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I name
the decoder name to query\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true if a decoder by that name is available, false
otherwise\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0
