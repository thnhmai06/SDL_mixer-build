.SH NAME
Mix_FadeInMusicPos \- Play a new music object, fading in the audio, from a starting position\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool Mix_FadeInMusicPos(Mix_Music *music, int loops, int ms, double position);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This will start the new music playing, much like

.BR Mix_PlayMusic
() will, but will start the music playing at
silence and fade in to its normal volume over the specified number of
milliseconds\[char46]

If there is already music playing, that music will be halted and the new
music object will take its place\[char46]

If
.BR loops
is greater than zero, loop the music that many times\[char46] If
.BR loops
is -1, loop "infinitely" (~65000 times)\[char46]

Fading music will change it's volume progressively, as if

.BR Mix_VolumeMusic
() was called on it (which is to say: you
probably shouldn't call 
.BR Mix_VolumeMusic
() on fading
music)\[char46]

This function allows the caller to start the music playback past the
beginning of its audio data\[char46] You may specify a start position, in seconds,
and the playback and fade-in will start there instead of with the first
samples of the music\[char46]

An app can specify a
.BR position
of 0\[char46]0 to start at the beginning of the
music (or just call 
.BR Mix_FadeInMusic
() instead)\[char46]

To convert from milliseconds, divide by 1000\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I music
the new music object to play\[char46]
.TP
.I loops
the number of times the chunk should loop, -1 to loop (not actually) infinitely\[char46]
.TP
.I ms
the number of milliseconds to spend fading in\[char46]
.TP
.I position
the start position within the music, in seconds, where playback should start\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call SDL_GetError() for
more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
