.TH Mix_ReserveChannels 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_ReserveChannels \- Reserve the first channels for the application\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int Mix_ReserveChannels(int num);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
While SDL_mixer will use up to the number of channels allocated by

.BR Mix_AllocateChannels
(), this sets channels aside
that will not be available when calling 
.BR Mix_PlayChannel

with a channel of -1 (play on the first unused channel)\[char46] In this case,
SDL_mixer will treat reserved channels as "used" whether anything is
playing on them at the moment or not\[char46]

This is useful if you've budgeted some channels for dedicated audio and the
rest are just used as they are available\[char46]

Calling this function will set channels 0 to
.BR n - 1
to be reserved\[char46] This
will not change channel allocations\[char46] The number of reserved channels will
be clamped to the current number allocated\[char46]

By default, no channels are reserved\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I num
number of channels to reserve, starting at index zero\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of reserved channels\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
