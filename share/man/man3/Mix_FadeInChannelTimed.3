.TH Mix_FadeInChannelTimed 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_FadeInChannelTimed \- Play an audio chunk on a specific channel, fading in the audio, for a maximum time\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int Mix_FadeInChannelTimed(int channel, Mix_Chunk *chunk, int loops, int ms, int ticks);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This will start the new sound playing, much like

.BR Mix_PlayChannel
() will, but will start the sound playing
at silence and fade in to its normal volume over the specified number of
milliseconds\[char46]

If the specified channel is -1, play on the first free channel (and return
-1 without playing anything new if no free channel was available)\[char46]

If a specific channel was requested, and there is a chunk already playing
there, that chunk will be halted and the new chunk will take its place\[char46]

If
.BR loops
is greater than zero, loop the sound that many times\[char46] If
.BR loops
is -1, loop "infinitely" (~65000 times)\[char46]
.BR ticks
specifies the maximum number of milliseconds to play this chunk
before halting it\[char46] If you want the chunk to play until all data has been
mixed, specify -1\[char46]

Note that this function does not block for the number of ticks requested;
it just schedules the chunk to play and notes the maximum for the mixer to
manage later, and returns immediately\[char46]

A fading channel will change it's volume progressively, as if

.BR Mix_Volume
() was called on it (which is to say: you probably
shouldn't call 
.BR Mix_Volume
() on a fading channel)\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I channel
the channel on which to play the new chunk, or -1 to find any available\[char46]
.TP
.I chunk
the new chunk to play\[char46]
.TP
.I loops
the number of times the chunk should loop, -1 to loop (not actually) infinitely\[char46]
.TP
.I ms
the number of milliseconds to spend fading in\[char46]
.TP
.I ticks
the maximum number of milliseconds of this chunk to mix for playback\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns which channel was used to play the sound, or -1 if sound
could not be played\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
