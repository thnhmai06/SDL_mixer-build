.BI "void Mix_Pause(int channel);

.SH DESCRIPTION
Pausing a channel will prevent further playback of the assigned chunk but
will maintain the chunk's current mixing position\[char46] When resumed, this
channel will continue to mix the chunk where it left off\[char46]

A paused channel can be resumed by calling 
.BR Mix_Resume
()\[char46]

A paused channel with an expiration will not expire while paused (the
expiration countdown will be adjusted once resumed)\[char46]

It is legal to halt a paused channel\[char46] Playing a new chunk on a paused
channel will replace the current chunk and unpause the channel\[char46]

Specifying a channel of -1 will pause _all_ channels\[char46] Any music is
unaffected\[char46]

You may not specify MAX_CHANNEL_POST for a channel\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I channel
the channel to pause, or -1 to pause all channels\[char46]
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
