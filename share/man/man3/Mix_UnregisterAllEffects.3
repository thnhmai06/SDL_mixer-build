.SH NAME
Mix_UnregisterAllEffects \- Explicitly unregister all special effect functions\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool Mix_UnregisterAllEffects(int channel);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
You may not need to call this at all, unless you need to stop all effects
from processing in the middle of a chunk's playback\[char46]

Note that this will also shut off some internal effect processing, since

.BR Mix_SetPanning
() and others may use this API under the
hood\[char46] This is called internally when a channel completes playback\[char46]
Posteffects are never implicitly unregistered as they are for channels, but
they may be explicitly unregistered through this function by specifying

.BR MIX_CHANNEL_POST
 for a channel\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I channel
the channel to unregister all effects on, or 
.BR MIX_CHANNEL_POST
\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true on success or false on failure; call SDL_GetError() for
more information\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
